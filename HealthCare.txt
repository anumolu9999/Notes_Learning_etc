Health ID Card:

Coverage for
Medical - Vision - Dental - Rx(Pharmacy)
Copay/Deductible/CoInsurance information for PCP/Specialist/ER/UrgentCare
INN(In Network)/OON (Out of Network) rates for Copay/Deductible/CoInsurance

RxBIN/RxPCN/RxGrp - 
Sometimes the medical insurance company does not cover prescriptions but prints the information of the prescription insurance company that does cover it on the same card.

Regardless of the insurance company, the pharmacy is looking for four pieces of necessary information.
RxBin - the Bank Identification Number routes a claim towards the right insurance
RxPCN - the Processor Control Number further narrows the claim to the specific insurance
ID - the member's designated identification number
RxGrp - the prescription group number denotes which group plan the member ID falls under

Project Management - Agile/Scrum
Principles
1. Empirical Process Control (emphasizes on core philosophy of scrum - Transparency/Inspection/Adaption)
2. Self - Organization (Focuses on today's workers - self organize other than working under command and control)
3. Collaboration (Awareness/articulation/appropriation - advocates project management as a shared value creation process)
4. Value-Based Prioritization (Max Buisness value from project starting and throughout project)
5. Time-Boxing (sprints/Daily standup/sprint Planning meeting/sprint review meetings)
6. Iterative Development (emphasizes on better management of changes to satisfy customer needs)

Aspects
1. Orgranization
2. Buissness Justification
3. Quality
4. Change
5. Risk

Processes (19 Processes in 5 Phases)
Phase 1: Initiate
Phase 2: Plan and Estimate
Phase 3: Implement
Phase 4: Review and Retrospect
Phase 5: Release

Scrum Ceremonies/meetings
	Project Vision Meeting - 	project vision statement created
	User group meeing 	   -	Develop epics and create UserStories
	Release planning sessions - create release planning schedule
	Product backlog review meeting -
	Sprint planning meeting 8hrs for 1month sprint (two parts 1.objective definition 2.Task Estimation(identify tasks and estimate tasks)
	Sprint review meeting 4hrs for 1month sprint (accepts/rejects completed user stories)
	Retrospect Sprint Meeting 4hrs for 1month sprint 
	Retrospect Release Meeting
	Daily standup - 15 mins(what is done from last standup, what to do before next meeting, any roadblocks)
	sprint - 1-4weeks(recommended 4weeks, extended to 6weeks for stable requirements)

RVU's
In healthcare, Relative Value Units (RVUs) are not a single formula but a scaled value assigned to each medical service, calculated as the 
sum of three components: 
    Work RVUs, 
    Practice Expense (PE) RVUs, and 
    Malpractice (MP) RVUs. 
The total RVU for a service is then multiplied by a Conversion Factor to determine the payment for that service.

Claims & Encounters

COB (Coordination Of Benefits)
    comes into picture when paties has multiple insurance plans
    COB determines which helath insurance plan pays first (primacy)
    Secondary plan may pay remaining eligible costs
  
    PRIMACY:::will tell about which is Primary HIP, which is Secondary HIP or tertiary HIP

EOB           - EOP
Explanation of - Explanation of Payment
Benefits
to Member    -  to Provider
No payment   - Yes payment related info (ERA)

CO - Contractual Obligation
Denials and Appeals
CO:16 - claims lacks info for adjudication
CO:50 - non covered services
CO:96 - Non covered charge
CO:18 - Duplicate Claim

Encounters : EDI837 but without charges info
             Mostly mandatory for MCO's (managed care organizations), state agency (eg: Medicaid)
  difference between claim837 vs encounter837 is at BHT segment at BHT06(6th element)

ICD-10 created by CMS and NCHS ((National Center for Health Statistics)
ICD-10 divided/consist of two medical code sets
1. Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) - Across all claims (Prof/inst IP/OP)
          Standardised classification system of diagnosis codes that represent conditions and disease, related health problems, abnoramal findings, signs and symptoms, injuries, external causes of injuries and diseases, and social circumstances
2. Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) (InPatient Procedures)
          Classification system of medical codes used in hospital settings to report inpatient procedures

Claims Pricing Context
	Scenario
Inpatient Hosp Claim - ICD10CM(Diagnosis)->ICD10 PCS (procedures inpatient) -> DRG -> Reimbursement
Outpatient/Prof claim - ICD10CM(diagnosis) -> CPT/HCPCS (op procedures) -> Fee Schedule

	5th char - Number or alpha (represents Anatomic site)
	6th char - Number or alpha (represents Severity)
	7th char - Number or alpha (represents extension/Obstetrics, injuries and external cause of injury)
	(optional)			often represents Episode of care

ICD-10-PCS: 7 Digit code alphanumeric
	1st Char - represents section
