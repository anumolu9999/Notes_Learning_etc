RVU's
In healthcare, Relative Value Units (RVUs) are not a single formula but a scaled value assigned to each medical service, calculated as the 
sum of three components: 
    Work RVUs, 
    Practice Expense (PE) RVUs, and 
    Malpractice (MP) RVUs. 
The total RVU for a service is then multiplied by a Conversion Factor to determine the payment for that service.
